### 🏘️ Housing Price prediction using Linear Regression 📈:

Navigating the intricate terrain of housing data, I conducted a thorough exploration encompassing data preprocessing, handling missing values, and deploying IQR-based outlier detection. With a keen focus on encoding, heat map visualization, and feature scaling, I crafted a resilient regression model utilizing both sklearn and the Ordinary Least Squares method from statsmodels. Rigorous evaluation, incorporating established metrics, enriched the depth of this data-centric odyssey. 🏡📊
